# Aline

Align text with a single simple command.

Aline is an alternative to [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular), but
with simpler commands.

Let Aline find where to start and end aligning

![fullAline](./assets/fullAline.gif)

Or specify the range yourself

![partialAline](./assets/partialAline.gif)

Different alignments are supported

![alignmentsAline](./assets/alignmentsAline.gif)

Align removing extra spaces

![spacesAline](./assets/spacesAline.gif)

Aline auto updates the alignment when text is changed

![updateAline](./assets/updateAline.gif)

## Features

* Simple usage, no complex regex patterns like in [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)
* No dependencies, works with only Vimscript
* Format using any separator
* Auto reformat modified text
* Python 3 aligning option

## Installation

Add this to your [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) configuration:

```vim
call plug#begin()
...
Plug 'vinicius-toshiyuki/aline.git'
...
call plug#end()
````

Exit Vim and run

```bash
vim +PlugInstall +qa
```

## Usage

There is no built-in documentation inside Vim yet.

The main command is `:[<range>]Aline <sep> [<options>]` with the cursor inside
the block of text to be formatted.

* `<range>` is the line range
  * Using a range implies `n` in the options
* `<sep>` is the separator
  * Can be more than one character
  * Spaces and `\` must be escaped
* `<options>` can be an alignment , `c` for clearing extra white spaces, `k` for
keeping spaces at start of line, a padding added to the separator, `n` to
disable update in this area.
  * `-`, `=`, `+` : left, center and right alignment, respectively
  * With `c` and a padding, spaces are cleared before inserting padding
  * `k` has no effect if `c` is not used
  * Options may be in any order
  * Do not include white spaces between options

There is also `:AlineEnableUpdate` and `:AlineDisableUpdate` for enabling and
disabling auto update for a file.
Auto update uses `CursorHold` and `CursorHoldI` events to refresh, change the
refresh interval with `set updatetime=300` or some other time in milliseconds
(default is `4000`).

## Customization

These variables can be set in your configuration file to change Aline's behavior:

* `g:aline#use_python3` (default=`v:false`): use Python 3 to align text
* `g:aline#max_line_count` (default=`100`): max text block line size to keep
auto updating when modified
* `g:aline#separator_padding` (default=`0`): white space padding added to the separator
* `g:aline#default_alignment` (default=`-`): alignment used if none was provided
* `g:aline#update#file_types` (default=`[]`): list of file extensions to enable
auto update automatically on opening a file

### Performance

While processing the text can be very quick, when used to format a block of text
too long it might take a few seconds for Vim to fetch the text and replace it
with the new one.
For this reason, auto update is disabled for long texts (`g:aline#max_line_count`).
